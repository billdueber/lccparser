%h2 Results

The parser attempts to break up a call number into the following pieces.

* Letters
* Digits (including decimal point, if necessary)
* First DOON ("Date or Other Number") (e.g., year of the war )
* First Cutter
* Second DOON
* Any other Cutters, comma-delimited
* The year of publication
* Everything else

%p 
  If you have a few minutes, please take the time to check/correct and then submit the correct parse. I'm throwing them all in a database and will use it drive more testing for the underlying parser.
  

%p Note: "extra" cutters (beyond the first) are entered in a single field, delimited by the comma (',') character.

            String could not be parsed by the parser. If that's correct, just leave
            everything blank and submit. If not, fix the values and submit those.
        %div.submit
          %input.submit_button{:type=>'submit', :value=>"Submit as correct"}
          %div.submitted_good Thanks. Submitted these values as correct
